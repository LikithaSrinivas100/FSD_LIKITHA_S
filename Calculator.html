<!-- <div> - div tag is a container element used to group other HTML elements together
    there are no other HTML elements inside this div
    there are two types of div tags: inline and block
    inline tag - is used to group elements that are displayed inline
    block tag - is used to group elements that are displayed as blocks
    div tag is a block-level element by default
    div tag can contain other block-level elements and inline elements
    div tag is often used with CSS to style groups of elements

    block tag different from inline tag:
    block tag - takes up the full width available, starts on a new line
    inline tag - takes up only as much width as necessary, does not start on a new line
    div tag is a block-level element, so it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line
    span tag is an inline element, so it takes up only as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line
