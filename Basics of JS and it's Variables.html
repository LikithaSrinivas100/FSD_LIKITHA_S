NOTES - 

This HTML document provides a basic introduction to JavaScript with styled headings and paragraphs.
JS is widely used for web development to create dynamic and interactive user experiences.
It is supported by all modern web browsers and can be used for both client-side and server-side development.
JS in html files allows developers to enhance the functionality of web pages.

example usage:
<script>
    alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");
</script>

types of variables in JS:
1. var - var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and updated. 
2. let - let is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope.
3. const - const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared; it must be initialized at the time of declaration.

Analogies:
- 'var' is like a reusable container that can be changed and reused within a function.
- 'let' is like a temporary box that can be changed but only within a specific block.
- 'const' is like a sealed box that cannot be changed once it is set.

types of data in JS:
1. Number - Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
2. String - Represents sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
3. Boolean - Represents true or false values.
4. Object - Represents collections of key-value pairs.
5. Array - Represents ordered lists of values.
6. Null - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
7. Undefined - Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
8. Symbol - Represents a unique and immutable primitive value.
9. BigInt - Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
10. Function - Represents reusable blocks of code that can be called with parameters.

Differences between JS and other programming languages:

1. Java vs JavaScript:
   - Java is a statically typed, compiled language primarily used for server-side applications, while JavaScript is a dynamically typed, interpreted language mainly used for client-side web development.
2. Python vs JavaScript:
   - Python emphasizes readability and simplicity with a clear syntax, while JavaScript has a more complex
    syntax and is primarily used for web development.
3. C++ vs JavaScript:
    - C++ is a statically typed, compiled language used for system/software development, while JavaScript is a dynamically typed, interpreted language used for web development.
4. Ruby vs JavaScript:
    - Ruby focuses on simplicity and productivity with an elegant syntax, while JavaScript is primarily used for web development with a more complex syntax.

What is a scripting language?
A scripting language is a programming language that is used to automate tasks and control the behavior of software applications. 
Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled, meaning that they are executed directly by an interpreter rather than being converted into machine code. 
They are often used for writing small programs or scripts that can be embedded within larger applications, such as web browsers or server-side environments. 
Examples of scripting languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
