        <h1> Introduction to Responsive Web Design</h1>
        <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that ensures web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. The goal of RWD is to create web pages that provide an optimal viewing experience, easy reading, and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a wide range of devices.</p>
        <h2>Key Features of Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flexible Grid Layouts: RWD uses flexible grid layouts that adapt to the screen size and orientation of the device. This allows content to be displayed in a way that is easy to read and navigate, regardless of the device being used.</li>
            <li>Flexible Images and Media: RWD employs techniques such as CSS media queries to ensure that images and other media elements are scaled appropriately for different screen sizes. This prevents images from being too large or too small on various devices.</li>
            <li>CSS Media Queries: Media queries allow developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as its width, height, resolution, and orientation. This enables the creation of tailored experiences for users on different devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Benefits of Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved User Experience: RWD provides a seamless and consistent experience across all devices, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
            <li>Cost-Effectiveness: Instead of creating separate websites for different devices, RWD allows for a single website that adapts to various screen sizes, reducing development and maintenance costs.</li>
            <li>Easier Maintenance: With RWD, updates and changes need to be made only once, rather than across multiple versions of a site, simplifying maintenance tasks.</li>
            <li>Better SEO Performance: Search engines favor mobile-friendly websites, and RWD can improve search engine rankings by providing a better user experience on mobile devices.</li>
        </ul>
